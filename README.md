0. Basic Arithmetic Exercise:
          Task Description:

                    You are required to complete a Python script that performs basic arithmetic operations with two predefined numbers. The script should do the following:

                    Assign specific values to two variables, number1 and number2.
                    Perform addition, subtraction, and multiplication on these numbers.
                    Print the results of these operations in a human-readable format.


1. Simple Interest Calculator

          Task Description:

                    Your task is to complete a Python script that calculates the simple interest earned on an investment over a period of time. The formula for simple interest is (I = P * R * T), where:

                    ( I ) is the interest earned,
                    ( P ) is the principal amount (initial investment),
                    ( R ) is the annual interest rate (as a decimal),
                    ( T ) is the time the money is invested for in years.
                    Instructions:

                    Create a file named simple_interest.py.
                    Define three variables in this file:
                    principal with a value of 1000 (representing $1000),
                    rate with a value of 0.05 (representing 5% annual interest rate),
                    time with a value of 3 (representing 3 years).
                    Calculate the simple interest using the formula provided and store the result in a variable named interest.
                    Print the calculated interest in a format: The simple interest is: [interest].

2. Calculate the Area of a Rectangle

          Task Description:

                    For this task, you are to write a Python script that calculates the area of a rectangle. The area of a rectangle is found by multiplying its length by its width.

                    Instructions:

                    Create a file named rectangle_area.py.
                    Define two variables in this file:
                    length with a value representing the length of the rectangle.
                    width with a value representing the width of the rectangle.
                    For simplicity, let’s use length = 10 and width = 5.
                    Calculate the area of the rectangle using the formula (Area = length × width) and store the result in a variable named area.
                    Print the calculated area in a format: The area of the rectangle is: [area].
